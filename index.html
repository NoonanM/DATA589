<div id="course-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Introductory course on spatial statistics focused on combining data
with models to generate mechanistic descriptions of spatial patterns.
Beginning from a discussion about the importance spatially collected
data, the course teaches methods for modelling spatial data for two
routinely occurring situations 1) when the locations of points are the
variable of interest, and 2) when the locations are an arbitrary
artefact of the sampling design. Emphasis is placed on understanding and
interpreting the analyses in an applied context.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>This course combines lectures on theory and concepts with time
practicing statistical tools in <code>R</code> based software packages.
The course is designed to equip students with the tools and knowledge
they need to perform a variety of analyses that can model common
features of spatial data. For each topic, there will be a core lecture
module and a lab based practical module. With the lectures, students
will learn the theory behind core modelling tools including point
process models, variograms, Kriging, co-Kriging- regression-Kriging, and
regression with correlated errors, while the lab modules are intended to
provide a pathway that students can follow over the longer term as their
skills develop.</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess spatial point data for distinctive patterns</li>
<li>Fit point process models via maximum likelihood</li>
<li>Calculate empirical variograms from spatially collected data</li>
<li>Model spatial autocorrelation structures</li>
<li>Predict from spatial autocorrelation models</li>
<li>Handle non-independence in spatial data</li>
<li>Link questions, analyses, and studying design</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-format" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Format</h2>
<p>The course is divided into core lectures and lab-based
practicals.</p>
<p><strong>Lectures</strong>: Lectures will cover the core concepts of
the course. Lecture slides will be posted on the course website prior to
the lecture. Students are encouraged to take notes, and to ask questions
in the lectures. Lectures will also be given in Zoom and a link to the
lecture is available here and in the Canvas navigation sidebar. All
lectures will be recorded and made available to the students (subject to
any unforseen technical issues). Questions will be used throughout the
lectures to reinforce key concepts. No grades are assigned to these
questions, but and students are encouraged to answer these to the best
of their ability in order to assist them in tracking their progress.</p>
<p><strong>Practicals</strong>: The computer-lab practicals use
structured tutorials designed to train students on the use of the
open-source software program R for applying the methods learned in the
lectures to data. The lectures will cover the material required for
students to complete the practical assignments, however, they are
designed to be complementary and not all the material in the practicals
will be covered in the lectures and vice versa. These also provide
training on communicating the results of statistical analyses, with a
focus on reproducibility. Assessment of student learning will be based
on submitted assignments (see detailed schedule below).</p>
<p><strong>Data analysis project</strong>: The core data analysis
project is a major component of the course and is designed to train
students in data analysis and presentation using best practices in open
science. The core project is divided into 2 components aimed at
replicating the typical analytical process: 1) the submission of a
written paper describing the work; and 2) the archiving of code to
ensure open and reproducible research (see details below).</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-course-checklist" class="section level2">
<h2>Pre-course Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>The material learned in most entry level statistics course provides
important background and context on the topics that will be covered in
this course. It is recommended that you re-familiarise yourself with
this material before the course (e.g., understand expectation values,
variances, covariance matrices, linear regression, error distributions,
etc.).</li>
<li>To fully engage in all of the course material will require a basic
familiarity with R. Working through the book `R for Beginners’ by
Paradis (available at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org"
class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a> (Links to an external site.)
–&gt; ~Documentation/Contributed) before beginning the course is a good
idea if you want to improve with R or with coding. Alternatively, the
swirl R package (available at: <a
href="https://swirlstats.com/students.html"
class="uri">https://swirlstats.com/students.html</a> (Links to an
external site.)) teaches R programming and data science interactively,
at your own pace, and right in the R console.</li>
<li>If you intend to use your personal computer during the course, it is
a good idea to try and install R, and RStudio before the course.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="optional-material" class="section level2">
<h2>Optional Material</h2>
<p>There is no textbook for this course, but if students are interested
in expanding their knowledge beyond what is covered in the course, the
following textbook is recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baddeley, Rubok, and Turner (2015). Spatial Point Patterns:
Methodology and Applications with R. Chapman and Hall. (Available
through the UBC Library)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-evaluation" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Evaluation</h2>
<p>The assignments and evaluation for this course are structured along
two distinct, but complimentary lines: i) guided practical assignments;
and ii) a core research project. The practical assignments are designed
to provide students with the opportunity to learn how to apply the
methods learned in the lectures to real data using the statistical
software R. The core research project is designed to train students in
data analysis and presentation using best practices in open science. The
core project is divided into 2 components aimed at replicating the
typical analytical process: 1) the submission of a written paper
describing the work; and 2) the archiving of code to ensure open and
reproducible research.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Practical Assignments and Participation (50%)</h3>
<p>Beginning the first week of class, students will be guided through
practicals during the lab sessions. They will then be asked to complete
practical assignments on a weekly basis. There will be a total of 4
practicals to be completed throughout the course. Each is designed to
provide students with the opportunity to learn how to apply the methods
learned in the lectures and labs to novel datasets using tools
implemented in the statistical software R. The purpose of these
practical assignments is to ensure that students have the skills
necessary to complete effective statistical analyses that are central to
scientific research. The skills gained by completing each week’s
assignment will also help students complete their research projects. The
course web page on github will host the practicals, and the various
datasets associated with each practical.
<!-- Lectures will be given on Tuesdays and Thursdays. After the Thursdays lecture, we will have covered all of the material that is needed to complete the week’s practical assignment material which is due before the start of the following Thursday lecture (to be submitted online via canvas). --></p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Students are to submit answers to all
questions in the practical. Each practical assignment is worth a total
of 12.5% of your total grade. Of this, 2.5% is given for submitting the
practical on time, irrespective of whether or not the answers are
correct. This is intended as the participation component of the course.
The remaining 10% comes from the answers provided. Solutions to each the
practicals will be posted after the weekly submission deadline. Late
practicals will be accepted after the solutions have been posted, but no
participation grade will be given.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-projects-50" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Projects (50%)</h3>
<p>Students will be required to complete one core data analysis project
for this course. This assignment is designed to provide students with an
opportunity to apply what they have learned in the lectures and
practicals in an unguided format as they would if they were analysing
data outside of a classroom setting. For this project, students will
apply the modelling tools covered in the lectures on an empirical
dataset (details below) and write a short report about their work on
these data summarising their findings. This paper should be comprised of
six sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References,
and an Appendix Section.</p>
<p><em>Introduction</em>: Provide a brief description of the study
system from which the data come and an outline of what questions you
intend on exploring with the data, citing all relevant literature.
Length: ca. 1-2 pages.</p>
<p><em>Methods</em>: Briefly describe how the data were collected and
what variables are included. Provide a detailed description of the
analytical workflow that was applied to the data, citing all relevant
literature and statistical packages employed. There should be enough
information that anyone can reproduce the workflow if they had access to
the data. Length: As long as necessary.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: Length: Describe your statistical findings. Tables
and figures should be used throughout. Length: As long as necessary.</p>
<p><em>Discussion</em>: Provide a brief summary of your findings and
place them in a biological context. Length: ca. 1-2 pages</p>
<p><em>References</em>: Include references to all necessary
literature.</p>
<p><em>Appendix</em>: The appendix material should include an html
document created via R markdown that details every step of the analyses.
The code should be commented and clearly show how you arrived at the
numbers presented in your results from the data on hand.</p>
<p><strong>Datasets</strong>: To complete these assignments, students
will have access to a number of pre-selected datasets. Students can opt
to use their own data to complete these assignments if they prefer, and
are encouraged to do so, but must seek instructor approval. If you
intend on using your own data, it is recommended that you discuss this
with the instructor as early as possible. The pre-selected datasets are
available on the course website.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Students are to submit their final paper by
the end of the day on Sunday of the 5th week of the course Papers will
be graded out of 100, and will be worth a total of 35% of your total
grade. Each section has the following value: Introduction 10%, Methods
25%, Results 20%, Discussion 10%, References 5%, and an Appendix Section
30%. Late papers will have 5% deducted per day that they are overdue,
and will receive a grade of zero if more than 20 days late without a
valid excuse.</p>
